# Note: To prevent Netlify secrets scanning from flagging VITE_SUPABASE_URL and
# VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY (which are public client-side keys), configure the following
# in your Netlify site settings under "Build & deploy" > "Environment variables":
#
# SECRETS_SCAN_OMIT_KEYS = VITE_SUPABASE_URL,VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
# SECRETS_SCAN_OMIT_PATHS = dist/**,docs/**
#
# Alternatively, you can disable secrets scanning entirely if these are the only
# "secrets" being detected:
# SECRETS_SCAN_ENABLED = false
