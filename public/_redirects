# Netlify redirects file for SPA routing
# This ensures all routes are handled by React Router
# Static assets (JS, CSS, images, etc.) are automatically served by Netlify
# This catch-all redirects all other routes to index.html with a 200 status
# The 200 status is important - it tells the browser the page exists (not a redirect)

/*    /index.html   200
